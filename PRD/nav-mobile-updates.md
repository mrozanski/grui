# Mobile nav updates

## Use collapsible nav bar on mobile

Use md: (768px) as the breakpoint to switch between horizontal navigation and hamburger menu to ensure the navigation is touch-friendly on mobile devices
Below that breakpoint, replace nav links in the header with hamburger menu icon (three horizontal lines)
When hamburger menu icon is tapped:
- the nav bar displays as a vertical list of links
- Hamburger menu icon is replaced with a close icon
- When close icon is tapped again, the nav bar collapses back into the hamburger menu icon
